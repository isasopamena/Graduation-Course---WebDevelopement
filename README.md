# Graduation-Course---WebPrgramming
All products made during the course. 

I have tried several different online tutorials to learn more about how to work with GSAP. This was my first time trying and learning about GSAP. I did have a bit of knowledge of HTML and CSS, but working with Javascript/GSAP is completely new. I skipped doing research first and went right into testing with different tutorials. I have tried 10 different projects with text and images.
